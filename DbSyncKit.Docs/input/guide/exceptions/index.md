# Handling Exceptions in DbSyncKit

DbSyncKit may encounter exceptions during various operations, such as database connections, synchronization, or data queries. This guide outlines common exceptions you may encounter and how to handle them.

## Exception Types

### MySQL Exceptions

1. **`MySqlException`**
   - Thrown by MySqlConnection or MySqlDataAdapter during MySQL-related operations.
   - Refer to the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/) for details on specific exceptions.

### MSSQL Exceptions

1. **`SqlException`**
   - Thrown by SqlConnection or SqlDataAdapter during MSSQL-related operations.
   - Refer to the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlexception) for details on specific exceptions.

## Handling Exceptions

When handling exceptions in DbSyncKit, consider the following approach:

```csharp
try
{
    // DbSyncKit operation that may throw exceptions
}
catch (MySqlException ex)
{
    // Handle MySQL-specific exceptions
    Console.WriteLine($"MySQL Exception: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (SqlException ex)
{
    // Handle MSSQL-specific exceptions
    Console.WriteLine($"MSSQL Exception: {ex.Message}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle general exceptions
    Console.WriteLine($"General Exception: {ex.Message}");
}
```

This approach allows you to differentiate between MySQL, MSSQL, and general exceptions and implement specific handling based on the context of the operation.
